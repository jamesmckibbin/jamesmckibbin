Aside from knowing how to make bagels, I also have a career in programming!

Hi, I'm James (they/them), and I make games! I've been a student at Champlain College for the past four years studying Game Programming, and I am hoping to start a career in the industry soon after completing my degree.

## Currently working on: 
  - DirectX 12 Renderer
  - Metis Map System
